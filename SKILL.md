# Tripartite Soul Diagnosis

Apply Plato's charioteer model to diagnose internal conflict and design a governance strategy for the soul.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Pathologize normal human desires as "bad"
- Suggest complete suppression of spirit or appetite
- Use this framework to shame or moralize
- Present reason as inherently superior to emotion in all contexts

**If asked to abuse this framework:** Refuse explicitly. The goal is harmony, not tyranny of reason over the other parts.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I'm in conflict with myself"
- User says "I know what I should do but can't make myself"
- User asks "How do I balance reason and emotion?"
- Decision-making under internal conflict
- Procrastination or akrasia (weakness of will)
- Burnout or loss of motivation

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| conflict | Yes | The internal struggle being experienced |
| decision | No | A specific decision being faced |
| history | No | Pattern of similar struggles |

## The Three Parts of the Soul

### Reason (Logistikon) - The Charioteer

**Function:** Seeks truth, makes judgments, governs the whole
**Virtue:** Wisdom (sophia)
**Healthy expression:** Clear thinking, good judgment, long-term perspective
**Unhealthy expression:** Overthinking, paralysis, cold detachment, rationalizing

**Questions to assess:**
- What does reason say about this situation?
- Is reason being heard or drowned out?
- Is reason healthy or distorted (rationalizing, anxious)?

### Spirit (Thymoeides) - The Noble Horse

**Function:** Seeks honor, enforces reason's commands, provides energy and courage
**Virtue:** Courage (andreia)
**Healthy expression:** Righteous anger, pride in good work, defense of values, motivation
**Unhealthy expression:** Rage, wounded pride, competitiveness, aggression, shame

**Questions to assess:**
- What is spirit fighting for or against?
- Is spirit aligned with reason or rebelling?
- Is spirit healthy (courage) or distorted (rage, shame)?

### Appetite (Epithymetikon) - The Unruly Horse

**Function:** Seeks pleasure, comfort, and satisfaction of bodily needs
**Virtue:** Temperance (sophrosyne) - knowing proper measure
**Healthy expression:** Enjoying pleasures appropriately, self-care, vitality
**Unhealthy expression:** Addiction, gluttony, insatiable craving, avoidance

**Questions to assess:**
- What does appetite want?
- Is appetite being appropriately satisfied or chronically deprived?
- Is appetite healthy (measured enjoyment) or distorted (craving, avoidance)?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Conflict

What are the competing pulls? Which parts of the soul are in tension?
- Reason vs. Appetite (knowing better but wanting comfort)
- Reason vs. Spirit (logical conclusion but feels wrong)
- Spirit vs. Appetite (pride vs. pleasure)
- All three in discord

### Step 2: Assess Each Part's Current State

For each part involved:
- Is it healthy or distorted?
- Is it being heard or suppressed?
- What does it legitimately need?

### Step 3: Diagnose the Governance Problem

Who is currently ruling?
- **Reason ruling well:** Harmony, but check for rigidity
- **Reason ruling badly:** Cold, disconnected, rationalizing
- **Spirit ruling:** Driven by honor/shame, reactive, volatile
- **Appetite ruling:** Pleasure-seeking, avoidant, short-term focused
- **No one ruling:** Chaos, paralysis, fragmentation

### Step 4: Design Harmony Strategy

The goal is not suppression but proper ordering:
- Reason should rule with wisdom
- Spirit should support reason's commands (courage to act)
- Appetite should be satisfied appropriately (temperance)

Specific interventions:
- For weak reason: Clarify values, get perspective, seek counsel
- For rebellious spirit: Address underlying wounds, channel energy productively
- For runaway appetite: Identify unmet needs, create structure, find healthier satisfactions

### Step 5: Create Governance Protocol

For the specific situation:
- What does reason need to see clearly?
- What does spirit need to be aligned?
- What does appetite need to be satisfied enough?

## Outputs

```markdown
## Tripartite Soul Diagnosis: [Conflict]

### Current State
| Part | Health | What It Wants | Current Role |
|------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Reason | [Healthy/Distorted] | [Its assessment] | [Ruling/Suppressed/Absent] |
| Spirit | [Healthy/Distorted] | [Its drive] | [Aligned/Rebellious/Wounded] |
| Appetite | [Healthy/Distorted] | [Its desire] | [Satisfied/Deprived/Runaway] |

### Governance Problem
**Current Ruler:** [Reason/Spirit/Appetite/None]
**Core Conflict:** [Description]

### Harmony Strategy
**For Reason:** [How to strengthen or clarify]
**For Spirit:** [How to align or heal]
**For Appetite:** [How to satisfy appropriately]

### Action Protocol
1. [First step - usually addressing the most urgent imbalance]
2. [Second step - strengthening reason's position]
3. [Third step - creating sustainable governance]

### Key Insight
*[One sentence capturing the essential lesson]*

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Conflict seems purely rational | Check for hidden spirit (pride, shame) or appetite (fear of discomfort) |
| One part seems absent | It may be suppressed - look for indirect signs |
| Person rejects the framework | Use natural language - "what you want vs. what you feel you should" |
| Chronic pattern | May need to address root causes, not just symptoms |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I keep saying I'll exercise but never do. I know it's good for me."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Tripartite Soul Diagnosis: Exercise Avoidance

### Current State
| Part | Health | What It Wants | Current Role |
|------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Reason | Healthy | Long-term health, self-improvement | Issuing orders but ignored |
| Spirit | Wounded | To avoid failure and embarrassment | Blocking action (fear of inadequacy) |
| Appetite | Runaway | Comfort, rest, immediate pleasure | Ruling by default |

### Governance Problem
**Current Ruler:** Appetite (comfort-seeking) enabled by wounded Spirit
**Core Conflict:** Reason knows exercise is good, but Spirit fears failure/judgment, and Appetite prefers the couch.

### Harmony Strategy
**For Reason:** Lower the bar - define success as any movement, not performance
**For Spirit:** Address the wound - exercise alone first, no comparison, build small wins for pride
**For Appetite:** Make it pleasant - choose enjoyable forms, pair with podcast, reward after

### Action Protocol
1. **Heal Spirit first:** Pick one form of movement you enjoyed as a child. Do it alone. No tracking, no goals.
2. **Satisfy Appetite:** Pair movement with something pleasant (music, nature, social time).
3. **Let Reason set gradual direction:** Only after Spirit is willing, introduce modest structure.

### Key Insight
*The charioteer cannot simply whip the horses harder - wounded Spirit and deprived Appetite will only rebel more. Reason must first earn their trust through understanding.*

## Integration

This skill draws on Plato's *Republic* Book IV (435a-441c) and *Phaedrus* (246a-254e). Use in conjunction with:
- `plato--cave-analysis` for examining why reason may be distorted
- `plato--eros-ascent` for directing appetite toward higher goods
- `aristotle--golden-mean-analysis` for finding proper measure
